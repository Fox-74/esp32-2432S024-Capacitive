# ESP32-2432S024  Capacitive Touch LVGL WIFI & Bluetooth Development Board

![ESP32-2432S024-Board](img/board_front.jpg "ESP32-2432S024 Board front" ) 

This is a development board designed around ESP32-WROOM-32 32-bit MCU Module, that includes:

- ESP32-WROOM-32 MCU
- 320x240 pixels TFT integration screen
- Capacitive touch based on CST820 chipset
- TF Card slot
- Battery connector (JST 1.24 2p Male) with IP5603 Power Bank System-On-Chip
- One RGB LED
- Speaker output based on SC8002B
- Photoresistor GT36516
- External JST 4p Female for GPIOs, Temperature and Humidity sensors

This board is inexpensive considering the number of integrated features with good build quality. Many projects can work out-the-box with relative fast start-up speed. However, this design appears to be produced (and copied) by multiple vendors and the documentation for this board is either difficult to find or fairly incomplete. 

The objective of this project is to provide a good starting point for developpers to create. 

## Requirements

This workspace is using the excellent plugin for VSCode  [Platformio](https://platformio.org). It doesn't require separed library configurations and file management. 

## Installation

Clone to repository and upload to the board.
